CONFIG INSTRUCTIONS:

This Painting Tool runs as a web application on Apache 2.4, and requires at least PHP 7 installed.

Before installing this:
- Ensure that you have a working web server. You can use Localhost to run it on your own device!
- Make sure the PHP is configured (you may need to download extensions for this)

To install this, simply copy the file and place it into a directory where it can be read by a web server.
Then, you can browse the website and have fun.

Ensure that you access the tool with a web browser pointed to the directory and/or file in question.
 - You may need to check the configuration settings if this fails.

Notes:
- The tool reads from a file known as r2m_saved.json, which contains the previous model data.
  - To load such data into the tool, simply replace the file with the model provided, and then refresh the page.
